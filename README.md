Performance-aware space shooter using Unity DOTS

## Assignment brief
Create a small space shooter game with the following features:
- Simple movement.
- Shooting.
- Waves of enemies.

The game needs to be programmed in a data-oriented way with the hardware in mind following this criteria:

- Are efficient in their heap allocations and memory usage.
- Use algorithms and loops that are smartly done and minimize negative impact in the user experience when employed at scale.
- Reuse software effectively and contain original code that is easy to understand and used by others.

## First data draft
This is my first rough draft on how i will try to structure data. It's not perfect and will probalby change during the process.   
However, this gives me an initial idea with a good overview of the project.
I got this template idea from reading [Unity Learns DOTS](https://learn.unity.com/course/dots-best-practices?uv=2021.3) in a section about [Data Design](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/part-2-data-design?uv=2021.3&courseId=60132919edbc2a56f9d439c3#62ab1c2eedbc2a7009eb3f0a).
